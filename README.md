The Decentralized Flexible Organization is a new concept, that reshapes how we’re building Decentralized Applications, solving some critical points of failure in the today’s Dapp ecosystem like the needs of a Legal Known Entity to Trust, the slowly Smart Contract Developing and the Centralized or Distributed Servers Needs.

The Decentralized Flexible Organisation is a basic layer independent from the functions of a Decentralized Applications, with the aim to rule all of the developing and upgrade of it since the beginning in an anonymous way.
In fact, using DFO, the first step to start building a Decentralized Application is to Deploy the DAO side, with the Voting Token information and the Voting Rules.

Once deployed the DFO Smart Contract works as a Proxy to route functions in Read/Write rules or read-only rules to the connected Smart Contracts or Non-Fungible Tokens, so at the end of the day, Token Holders can vote the edit, kill or add functionality and design features of the Decentralized Application.
Basically, the community can BUIDL, and 100% rule it without needs to trust an entity or to trust each other.

A DFO is a self-sustainable ecosystem that works like a Proxy to connect permitted SmartContract as microservices defining a new Flexible and Innovative way to build DApps.
Too rule a DApp, the DAO can introduce a new way to build SmartContracts as happened in the Web 2.0 from dangerous monolith coding to fault-tolerant microservices approach. 
So, at the end of the day, if a SmartContract fails the DApp remains anyway fully operative.
And this is why we called it Flexible.

This is the Proxy which represents the DFO itself.

DFO is composed by a series of functionalities.
Each functionality is a SmartContract.
Each functionality/SmartContract can be plugged-in/out or replaced in any moment and for any reason, like microservices.

It needs a community survey to create/edit/replace a functionality.
A survey is voted with a ERC20 voting Token, created for the specific DFC.
Survey rules like duration (in blocks) and votes weight are also pluggable DFC functionalities (called Well Known Functionalities, which CANNOT be totally disabled) that can be replaced with Surveys voted by token holders.

# How Does it work?
In a DFO environment, Anyone or Token Holders (as pre-decided when the DFO is deployed) are able to deploy a Smart Contract or a series of chained NFTs and request to the Token Holders to connect it with the proxy as a new functionality, or to edit an existent functionality, by creating a “Survey Smart Contract” by adding a simple request to the DFO Proxy Smart Contract.
Once the voting period is finished anyone can trigger the finished event and automatically the Proxy Smart Contract will kill the old version of the functionality, if the survey was based on “Edit” or will add the new functionality, if the survey was based on “Add new”. (Voting rules and Block Time for the survey are pre-decided when the DFO is deployed and can be changed in the same way of changing any other functionality)

To reach this goal, the DFO is introducing a new way to deploy Flexible Decentralized Applications that will enable an interesting, smart way to code and deploy Smart Contracts, more like Microservices, and this is why we called it “Flexible” rather than “Autonomous.”
This Microservices kind of developing is fascinating because can introduce a new wave of Decentralized Application where if a single Smart Contract is broken, don’t block the entire application security and usability, but only the single function and it’ll be killed or edited fast without needs to a single entity to do emergency strategies like to fork the entire application.

Another important step forward is the idea to introduce NFTs for Front-End Code, so the DFO proxy is able to redirect users to the right NFTs to download the frontend code when a user’s browsers want to surf the Decentralized Application, and at the same time, Token Holders are able to easily vote for the front end connecting the Proxy to the chained NFTs they prefer.
The concept of Non-Fungible Tokens for the Front-End is possible with this open source protocol Developed by me and Marco Vasapollo: https://github.com/b-u-i-d-l/ROBE to build chained NFTs that are able to store pieces of information surpassing the limits of a single NFT.

With ROBE if an application is able to call the first or any other NFTs in a chain, it can easily take the rooting one and read all of the information stored in every NFT in the chain.
This setup is a step forward for building Decentralized Application, that can be hosted by anyone in every kind of domain name, just adding one or two simple lines of code to redirect users to the Proxy of the DFO, making Dapps more censorship-resistant than ever before.
